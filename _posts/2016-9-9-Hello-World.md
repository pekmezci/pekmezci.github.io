Some of my interest areas are Embedded Systems, High Performance Computing, Sensor Technologies with Artificial Intelligence methods from semiconductor fabric to functional device sign-off in hardware and accompanying software.

There is no need to say, most of the projects that I have been involved were in private repositories or just developed in-house. There is only a few can be found in public repositories Bitbucket, Google Code:(shut down) and [ my git repository](https://github.com/pekmezci) on GitHub.

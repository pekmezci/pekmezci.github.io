title: About My Interests and Expertise
---
I'm passionate about a range of subjects, such as cybersecurity, harnessing data analysis for valuable insights, high-performance computing, and leveraging artificial intelligence to uncover patterns and extract features.

I'm also keen on delving into the exciting world of ASIC/FPGA technology, particularly for high-frequency data applications, network research, and photonics.

Additionally, I'm intrigued by the ways implied volatility surfaces can assist in managing risk and understanding market depth in dynamic markets.

Regrettably, many of the projects I've been involved in are kept under wraps due to NDAs, but you can find a few of my contributions in public repositories like Bitbucket and previously on Google Code, which, unfortunately, has been discontinued.

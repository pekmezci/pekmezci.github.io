title: Welcome to know about me!
---
I'm interested in a variety of subjects, including Cybersecurity, using data analysis to gain insights, High Performance Computing, and using Artificial Intelligence to analyze patterns and extract features.

I'm also interested in using ASIC/FPGA technology to work with High Frequency Data Applications, Network Research, and Photonics.

I'm also interested in exploring the ways that implied volatility surface can help with risk aversion and market depth in dynamic markets.

Unfortunately, most of the projects I've worked on are private due to NDAs, but a few can be found on public repositories like Bitbucket, Google Code (which is now shut down), and [ my git repository](https://github.com/pekmezci) on GitHub.

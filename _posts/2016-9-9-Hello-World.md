Some of my interest areas are Quantitative Analysis of the Data, High Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence based Feature Extraction and Pattern Analysis.

ASIC/FPGA based works focus on High Frequency Data Applications, Network Research and Photonics.

Risk aversion and market depth in dynamic markets through implied volatility surface my portfolio interests.

There is no need to say, most of the projects that I have been involved are in private repositories and/or in-house servers due to NDAs. There is only a few can be found in public repositories Bitbucket, Google Code:(shut down) and [ my git repository](https://github.com/pekmezci) on GitHub.

I am a hardware/software engineer and the founder of LineByte. My main area of interest is embedded systems, and my work in that area has won awards from London,ERDF. Thanks to my colleagues and supervisors, I received prestigious grants/scholarships such as Erasmus Mundus Embedded Computing Systems (EMECS) EU scholarship, DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service). Previously at the University of Southampton, then the University of Kaiserslautern, and my journey continues in Germany, where I am interested in working on fine tuning computational engineering in hardware and software. I believe that ongoing research is crucial for development.

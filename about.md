I've had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional individuals throughout my career. With their unwavering support and guidance, my work in embedded systems has earned recognition, including awards from London and ERDF. I've also been honoured to receive prestigious grants and scholarships, such as the Erasmus Mundus Embedded Computing Systems (EMECS) EU scholarship and the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) scholarship.

My professional journey has encompassed a diverse range of exciting projects, involving partnerships with esteemed institutions like Cranfield University, the University of Southampton, the University of Hertfordshire, and the University of Kaiserslautern. These experiences have enabled me to cultivate expertise in cybersecurity and AI-focused IoT systems, alongside refining my skills in FPGA hardware and software development.

I firmly believe that ongoing research plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of technology. I am deeply passionate about contributing to this ongoing effort through my work. Ultimately, my objective is to devise innovative solutions that can contribute to making the world a better and safer place.
